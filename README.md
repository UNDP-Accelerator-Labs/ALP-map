Visualizing Accelerator Labs Action Learning Plans

The UNDP Accelerator Labs regularly produce Action Learning Plans (ALPs) to chart their activities and learning journey. They do this through a digital platform that comes with a tagging functionality. Labs can use any tag, giving rise to a [folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy), rather than a taxonomy proper. It is possible – and encouraged – to add to each ALP more than one tag. This gives rise to a network of co-occurring tags; here, we provide a visualization of this network. Each dot represents a tag used to categorize an article. Co-occurrence edges are not drawn in the default view. The dots are clustered by semantics, so conceptually similar topics should appear in the same cluster.

You can click on a cluster to bring up articles with those tags. The articles will show on the right side. Then, when hovering the articles on the side it will show the co-occurrence edges incident to the tags of this article. This allows you to see how tags co-occur with one another.
