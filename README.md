Visualizing Accelerator Labs Action Learning Plans

Each dot in the visualization represents a tag used to categorize an article.
The dots are clustered by semantics, so conceptually similar topics should appear in the same cluster.
You can click on a cluster to bring up articles with those tags.
The articles will show on the right side.
Then, when hovering the articles on the side it will show the connection of the tags of this article.
This allows you to see how tags are connected to each other (in terms of co-occurrence).
